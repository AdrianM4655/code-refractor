### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them.

[GitBash] : (https://git-scm.com/downloads)
[Visual Studios Code] : (https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
[Git Hub] : (https://desktop.github.com/)
```

### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running.

Step one : Downloading from git!
To get a copy of my project for yourself, you first need to go to my project (linked below) and you fork a copy of it and place it in your own github repository!
```
Step two : Downloading to Machine!
From your own repository, press on the green code button, and copy the link that says ssh to your clipboard!
```

Step three : Git Clone
One you have that copied to your clipboard, go ahead and open up git bash! Once in gitbash, change to the directory of your choice and enter the command, git clone, once this is done, the project should start cloning to your machine!
```
Step four : Final Steps
One that is done, go ahead and change directories to that file just cloned! Once there either drag the file to be opened in VSC or in git bash type, 'code .', this should open up the program and you can edit and change anything you want in the project!
